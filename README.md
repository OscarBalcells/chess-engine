# Lightweight C++ Chess Engine

Probably the simplest chess engine you can find online. This engine has an ELO of aroundÂ 1100 (?) and it's search function is a basic minimax with alpha-beta cutoffs and quiescential search (capture-moves only). The main search can do a depth of 7 half-moves in about 5 seconds.
