# Lightweight C++ Chess Engine

Probably the simplest chess engine you can find online. This engine has an ELO of aroundÂ 1100 (?) and it's search function is a basic minimax with alpha-beta cutoffs and quiescential search (capture-moves only). The main search can do a depth of 8 half-moves in about 5 seconds.

I have ported the C++ code to Javascript using [Emscripten]() and I have set up a small (actually not yet) [site](https://obalcells.github.io/chess) where you can play against the bot.

If you are looking to better understand chess engines or even code your own, the following sites may be useful:
1. [Chessprogramming Wiki](https://www.chessprogramming.org/Main_Page).
2. [Tom Kerrigan's Simple Chess Programm Source Code](http://www.tckerrigan.com/Chess/TSCP/)

# TO-DO List

## Short-term
1. Test castling bug
2. Simplify flagging (?)
4. Change eval to incentivise pawn openings
3. Add checkmate detection

## Long-term
1. Code my own eval function
2. Port to Javascript with Emscripten and setup github site
3. Estimate bot's ELO
4. Reach (non-quiescential) search depth of 8 or 9
