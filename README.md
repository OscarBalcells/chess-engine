This may not be the best chess engine, but it is a chess engine.

It does minimax search with alpha-beta pruning together with some other optimizations such as null-move optimization and quiescence search. It uses a classical 2-dimensional array for representing the board. It might be slow, but still, it isn't easy to defeat it. I would guess that its ELO lies around 1400.
